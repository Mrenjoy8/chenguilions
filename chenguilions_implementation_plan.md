# MegaMerge (Hexagonal 2048) Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Systems
### 1. Hexagonal Grid Foundation
- [ ] Implement hex grid coordinate system (offset coordinates)
- [ ] Render basic hexagonal tile display
- [ ] Create grid initialization logic (5-hexagon width, 37 tiles)
- [ ] Establish swipe detection for 6 directions (60° increments)

### 2. Base-3 Merge Mechanics
- [ ] Implement tile movement in swipe direction
- [ ] Design 3-tile merge detection (adjacent triplets)
- [ ] Create progression sequence:  
  `2 → 6 → 18 → 54 → 162 → 486 → 1,458 → 4,374 → 13,122 → 39,366 → 118,098 → 354,294 → 1,062,882`
- [ ] Score calculation based on merged values

## Phase 2: Game Modes
### 1. Classic Mode
- [ ] Win condition: 1,000,000 tile creation
- [ ] Loss condition: Full grid with no valid moves
- [ ] Undo functionality (3 uses per game)
- [ ] High score tracking (local storage)

### 2. Time Trial (60s)
- [ ] Countdown timer display
- [ ] Score multiplier for consecutive merges
- [ ] "Time freeze" power-up (3s pause)
- [ ] Post-game score submission

### 3. Fast Pace Mode
- [ ] Automatic tile spawn every second
- [ ] Grid fullness detection
- [ ] "Bomb" power-up (removes random tile every 30s)
- [ ] Survival time tracking

## Phase 3: Polish & UX
### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Tile color gradient by value
- [ ] Merge animation (triplet combination)
- [ ] Particle effects for large merges
- [ ] Directional swipe hint arrows

### Audio Design
- [ ] Merge sound effects (pitch scales with value)
- [ ] Background music toggle
- [ ] Mode-specific sound tones

## Phase 4: Meta Systems
### 1. Progress Tracking
- [ ] Session statistics (moves, merges, highest tile)
- [ ] Achievement system (milestone unlocks)

### 2. Adaptive Difficulty
- [ ] Dynamic spawn rates based on performance
- [ ] "Panic mode" near grid fullness (visual warning)

### 3. Accessibility
- [ ] Colorblind mode
- [ ] Swipe sensitivity adjustment
- [ ] Font size scaling

## Phase Order Rationale
1. **Core First**: Grid+merges enable all modes
2. **Modes Before Polish**: Verify gameplay fun before UI investment
3. **Meta Last**: Built on stable foundation

## Suggested Cursor Workflow
1. Start with `hex-grid.js` for Phase 1
2. Build `game-modes.js` for Phase 2
3. Create `visual-fx.js` for Phase 3
4. Finish with `meta-systems.js` for Phase 4
